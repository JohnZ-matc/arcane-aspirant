Each version number of the Hardy Horse sprite sheets represents a different color palette.
Make sure you use the same version number for the "top" and "bottom" layers so the colors match.

The official color swaps are based on real-world horse colors, here's a list of what they're supposed to be:

	v00 - Wild bay
	v01 - Chestnut
	v02 - Red chestnut
	v03 - Light chestnut
	v04 - Golden chestnut
	v05 - Honey chestnut
	v06 - Dark chestnut
	v07 - Black chestnut
	v08 - Golden palomino
	v09 - Chocolate palomino
	v10 - Isabella palomino
	v11 - Black
	v12 - Champagne black
	v13 - Classic silver
	v14 - Red silver
	v15 - Amber champagne
	v16 - Amber silver

I'll add more in a future update when I add spots and painted color patterns.

Supernatural horses (like a unicorn or nightmare) will be sold separately (someday).
